### What I learned
Hello community!! First of all I want to say that in this project I used or at least I tried to use more utility classes and also I did use a reset for my css styles, for this project I also did some kind of script in js for the button of the menu... to be honest is not the big deal, hopefully I am gonna use more javascript in another challenge, so that's all, see ya everybody!..(any tip or advice is more than welcome, as always).
